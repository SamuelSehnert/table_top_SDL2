I wanted to try my hand at SDL2, so here we are!

Also, I'm using this project to practice my general C++ abilities!

If you want to compile and use this:
    1) Make sure you have SDL2 and SDL2_ttf
        a) I used pacman, but I think you can find the source code
    2) run: make all
    3) then: ./table_top
    4) Should work?
