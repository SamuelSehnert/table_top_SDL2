I wanted to try my hand at SDL2, so here we are!

Also, I'm using this project to practice my general C++ abilities!

If you want to compile and use this:

    1) Make sure you have SDL2 and SDL2_ttf

        a) I used pacman, but I think you can find the source code

    2) run: make all

    3) then: ./table_top

    4) Should work?

For my own santiy:

    The next plan is to have the floor be an object with a pointer to whatever is on top

    When I loop to print, I want to run up the chain of each floor obj and print whatever the topmost object is
